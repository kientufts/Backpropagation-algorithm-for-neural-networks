# Backpropagation-algorithm-for-neural-networks

1. Data
In this assignment we use two datasets which you can find on the course web page. The first captures the
8-3-8 network example data from [M] which was shown in lecture. The second is a digit recognition dataset1
For this assignment we have already split the data into train and test portions. The files are in arff format
so you should be able to use your reader from previous assignments to read the data files. To be clear you
can reuse your own code from a previous assignment but please do not use wekaâ€™s code or code from any
other source for that purpose
