# Backpropagation-algorithm-for-neural-networks

## Data

We have two datasets. The [first](https://github.com/kientufts/Backpropagation-algorithm-for-neural-networks/blob/master/838.arff) captures the 8-3-8 network example data from [1]. The second is a digit recognition dataset1.
For this project we have already split the data into train and test portions.
